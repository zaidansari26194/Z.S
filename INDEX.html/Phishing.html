<font size= 18 face= "copperplate gothic"><p>Phishing is a deceptive cybercrime where attackers impersonate trustworthy entities to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. <br>
    <br>
<b><u>How phishing works?</u></b><br>
<br>
•	Attackers craft emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate to lure victims.<br>
•	These communications often contain urgent language or enticing offers to manipulate the recipient.<br>
•	Victims might be tricked into clicking malicious links or downloading infected attachments that can install malware or redirect to fake websites.<br>
•	Fake websites are designed to steal personal and financial data such as passwords, account IDs, or credit card details. <br>
<br>
<u><b>Common types of phishing attacks</b></u><br>
<br>
<b><u>Phishing attacks can take various forms, including:</u></b><br>
•	<u>Email Phishing:</u> Using fraudulent emails that look like they're from legitimate sources.<br>
•	<u>Spear Phishing:</u> Highly targeted attacks aimed at specific people or groups.<br>
•	<u>Whaling:</u> A type of spear phishing that targets high-ranking individuals.<br>
•	<u>Vishing (Voice Phishing):</u> Using phone calls to impersonate trusted entities.<br>
•	<u>Smishing (SMS Phishing):</u> Sending deceptive text messages.<br>
•	<u>Pharming:</u> Redirecting users to fake websites.<br>
•	<u>Clone Phishing:</u> Modifying a previously sent legitimate email to include malicious content. <br>
<br>
<u><B>Identifying phishing attempts</B></u><br>
<br>
<u>Signs of a phishing attempt include:</u><br>
•	Suspicious sender email addresses.<br>
•	Urgent language.<br>
•	Unfamiliar links or attachments.<br>
•	Mismatched URLs when hovering over links.<br>
•	Spelling or grammar errors. <br>
<br>
<u><b>Consequences of falling victim</b></u><br>
<br>
Falling for a phishing attack can lead to financial loss, identity theft, compromised account security, and for businesses, damage to reputation and potential legal issues. <br>
Preventing phishing attacks<br>
<br>
<u><b>To protect yourself:</b></u><br>
•	Be cautious of unexpected communications asking for sensitive information.<br>
•	Verify the sender's identity through official channels.<br>
•	Hover over links to check the destination URL before clicking.<br>
•	Keep your software updated.<br>
•	Use two-factor authentication.<br>
•	Report any suspicious activity.<br> 
<br>
Staying informed and vigilant can significantly lower your risk of becoming a phishing victim. <br>
